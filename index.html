	 Aperture refers to the opening of a lens's diaphragm through which light passes. It is calibrated in f/stops and is generally written as numbers such as 1.4, 2, 2.8, 4, 5.6, 8, 11 and 16. Lower f/stops give more exposure because they represent the larger apertures, while the higher f/stops give less exposure because they represent smaller apertures. This may seem a little contradictory at first but will become clearer as you take pictures at varying f/stops.</p> </div></section>

	 <section class="ISO">
                <h2 align="center">ISO</h2>
                 The ISO setting is one of three elements used to control exposure; the other two are f/stop and shutter speed. In most cases manually setting the f/stop and shutter speed, or using one of the camera's automatic exposure controls (aperture- or shutter-priority, for example) is all you'll need to do. But when the situation calls for a shallow depth-of-field and, thus, a wide lens opening, and/or a fast shutter speed, that combination may not allow enough light to reach the sensor. </p> </div></section>

 <section class="Shutter">
                <h2 align="center">Shutter Speed</h2>
	 	Shutter speed is how long an image is exposed to light — it can be milliseconds, or even minutes. As one of three elements that affect how light or dark an image is (called exposure), understanding shutter speed is essential to taking full creative control of the camera.A camera takes a photograph by exposing a digital sensor (or a piece of film) to light. 
The shutter speed, then, is just how long that barrier stays open to let light into the image. Shutter speed is how long an image is exposed to light — it can be milliseconds, or even minutes.
